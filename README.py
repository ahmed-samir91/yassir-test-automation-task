Description

I have used RobotFramework to automate the tests for this task, As RobotFramework is a very powerful tool we can use it to automate Webapps using a selenium library incluced inside and APIs using requests library. In addintion to all of that RobotFramework is a keyword driven tool, very easy to read and it uses python if you need to add a new keyword.
